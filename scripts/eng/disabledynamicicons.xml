            <title>Disable dynamic icons for some apps</title>
            <desc>Select the app you want to disable the animated icon below, and it will be automatically disabled during subsequent installations. Please select according to your needs. If you need to disable all, please use Disable All below. It is not recommended to use the select all function in the list (it will reduce the installation efficiency). All apps will be displayed in the list, which does not mean that the apps in the list use dynamic icons.
Again, choose according to your needs, don't choose all!</desc>
