        <slice break="true" size="13">The download uses the download activity provided by kr-script, but in a very small number of systems, there may be compatibility issues. If this happens, please turn on the download compatibility switch below to try to solve it.

After turning on the compatibility mode, it will download silently, without a download progress bar. Please wait patiently for the download to complete when you see it stop at the download stage.</slice>
